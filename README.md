# OutsideOkay

Outside Okay is a website that was created at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to help inform community residents about the risk of exposure to COVID-19. The site also informs users of techniques to prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as, washing your hands, wearing a mask, etc. A user is prompted to input their zipcode and based on the COVID-19 cases in their area, a percentage of exposure risk if returned. The cases were supplied by a New York Times repository that listed the active cases in every zip code of the United States. The formula was derived from communciations that our team had with an epidemiologist, but it should be noted it is not an exactly precise percentage.
